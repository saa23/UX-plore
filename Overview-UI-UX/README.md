### II. UX (User Experience)

UX includes the entire product design.

### III. CX (Customer Experience)
The customer's experience has of the brand/organization (not only in product level) throughout all the touchpoints that take place during customer interaction with the brand's product before and after conversion.

### IV. UI-UX-CX relationship
CX includes all interactions with users/ customer (not only within product page).
While UX includes the user experience in interacting within the product.
Unlike both of them, UI focuses more on the visual experience aspect of a product. <br>
Therefore, these three aspects mutually influence the user's experience/sentiment towards the product or brand.
