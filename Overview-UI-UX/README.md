# Overview UI-UX


## 1. UI and UX Overview

### I. UI (User Interface)
The objective is to create a visual experience that includes all visual components on the product page as well as points of visual interaction within the product page. <br>
UI represents the aesthetic values of the product which ultimately have an impact on the user's experience when interacting with the product.

### II. UX (User Experience)
Aims to create relevant and meaningful experiences while users interact with the product. <br>
UX includes the entire product design.

### III. CX (Customer Experience)
The customer's experience has of the brand/organization (not only in product level) throughout all the touchpoints that take place during customer interaction with the brand's product before and after conversion.

### IV. UI-UX-CX relationship
CX includes all interactions with users/ customer (not only within product page).
While UX includes the user experience in interacting within the product.
Unlike both of them, UI focuses more on the visual experience aspect of a product. <br>
Therefore, these three aspects mutually influence the user's experience/sentiment towards the product or brand.

The basis of the design goal.
The targets are user needs and business objectives

2.	Scope <br>
The domain is the definition of the product scope.
The target is functional specification & content requirements where development refers to user needs defined in the previous element.

Setup user and product interaction design.
The target is information architecture & Interaction Design.

4.	Skeleton <br>
Related to product layout/product display framework.
The targets are navigation design, interface design, & information design.

5.	Surface <br>
Visual design that will be seen by users. The target is visual elements such as images, colors, illustrations, icons, animations, and etc.


### II. Usability
Usability = how easy the user interface is to use.

How easy the user can complete tasks to meet goals the first time they use it.
2. Efficiency <br>
After the user is able to grasp how the product works by completing a task, then how quickly the user is able to do the next task.
3. Memorability <br>
When users have not used the product for while, how easy it is for them to re-establish fluency when interacting with the product 
4. Error <br>
How many errors did the user make, how fatal were the errors, and how easy was it for the user to find the solution.
5. Satisfaction <br>
