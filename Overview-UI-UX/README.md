UX includes the entire product design.

### III. CX (Customer Experience)

### IV. UI-UX-CX relationship
CX includes all interactions with users/ customer (not only within product page).
While UX includes the user experience in interacting within the product.
Unlike both of them, UI focuses more on the visual experience aspect of a product. <br>
Therefore, these three aspects mutually influence the user's experience/sentiment towards the product or brand.
